						<p> This webpage is interesting to me because it uses a bright color scheme with illustrative 
							qualities like texture and hand drawn type to create a cohesive design.  The part of this 
							webpage that stands out to me is the interactive quality of the homepage.  It 
							shows the two band members posing and the viewer can scroll through various outfits for
							them to wear.</p>
